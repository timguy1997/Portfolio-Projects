# Data Analyst Portfolio by Tim Matthews Jr
This portfolio is a way to demonstrate my skills as a data analyst. Though I have been working professionally with data for a little over a year now, I have not had much to showcase the skills that I've procured through my job and in my free time. 

## Independent Projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Exploratory COVID Data Analysis in SQL Server and Visualization in Tableau
 In this project I performed exploratory data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server along with Microsoft Excel to initially format some of the data. In this project I highlight key insights
  regarding the lethality and spread of COVID and show vaccination rates across the globe. Check it out<a href = "https://github.com/timguy1997/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL_DATA%20_EXPLORATION%202-3-2024.sql"> here</a>. I then took my data exploration a few steps further and visualized it in Tableau showing important summary information regarding infection and mortality globally.

## SQL Scripts.

### SQL Server Data Cleaning with Nashville Housing Dataset
  The Nashville housing dataset is a classic example set of data to show off data cleaning skills in SQL. Here I was able to combine Excel with SQL Server to comb through the data, clean it, and format it so that
  it's ready for a detailed and insightful analysis. You can see how I did all this right<a href = "https://github.com/timguy1997/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/sql/Finished%20NashvilleHousing%20Data%20Cleaning%20Project%203-02-2024.sql"> here</a>.


## Tableau Visualizations and Dashboards

### South Side of Chicago Foraging Project
  I did this project for fun and gathered the data from a site called FallingFruit.org. I've identified several sources of herbs, nuts, and fruits that can be foraged in Chicago's south side neighborhoods and leave the longitude and latitude for anyone looking to find each source of nutrients.
