# Data Analyst Portfolio by Tim Matthews Jr
This portfolio is a way to demonstrate my skills as a data analyst. Though I have been working professionally with data for a little over a year now, I have not had much to showcase my skills that I've procured through
my job and in my free time. 
## SQL Scripts and Projects.

### SQL Data Exploration with COVID Dataset
  In this project I performed exploratory data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server along with Microsoft Excel to initially format some of the data. In this project I highlight key insights
  regarding the lethality and spread of COVID and show vaccination rates in across the globe. Check it out<a href = "https://github.com/timguy1997/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL_DATA%20_EXPLORATION%202-3-2024.sql"> here.</a>
