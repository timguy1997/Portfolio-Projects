# Data Analyst Portfolio by Tim Matthews Jr

my job and in my free time.

  In this project I performed exploratory data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server along with Microsoft Excel to initially format some of the data. In this project I highlight key insights
  regarding the lethality and spread of COVID and show vaccination rates in across the globe.
